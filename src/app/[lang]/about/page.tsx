          Currently based in Venezuela, I am always seeking new opportunities to
          learn and grow. In my free time, I enjoy delving into various topics
          of interest, such as reading light novels, watching anime, playing
          video games and playing board games. I am an enthusiastic board games
          player, it allows me to think strategically, to socialize and to have
          fun with friends and family. I am also an avid enthusiast of geek
          culture and always excited to engage in meaningful conversations with
          friends and peers.
